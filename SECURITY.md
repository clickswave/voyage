## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Voyage, please **do not** disclose it publicly. Instead, follow these steps:

1. **Contact us privately** at [security@clickswave.com](mailto:security@clickswave.com) with a detailed report of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it.
2. Allow us reasonable time to investigate and patch the issue before any public disclosure.
3. We will acknowledge receipt of your report and provide updates on the mitigation process.
4. Once resolved, we will credit responsible disclosures in our security advisories (unless requested otherwise).

## Security Best Practices

To ensure safe usage of Voyage, consider the following:

- **Review installation scripts**: If using automated install scripts, always inspect them before executing.
- **Use prebuilt binaries from trusted sources**: Download official releases only from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/clickswave/voyage/releases) page.
- **Keep software updated**: Use the latest version to benefit from security patches and improvements.
- **Run with appropriate permissions**: Avoid executing Voyage as root/administrator unless absolutely necessary.
- **Secure your environment**: Be mindful of where you run Voyage, as subdomain enumeration tools can generate a large number of network requests.

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow a responsible disclosure policy and appreciate ethical security researchers who help us improve Voyage. If you adhere to responsible disclosure, we will make every effort to acknowledge your contribution.

For any security concerns, please reach out to us at [security@clickswave.com](mailto:security@clickswave.com).

Thank you for helping keep Voyage secure!
